# Raqmiva — Bilingual AI Receptionist Demo

A minimal, white-screen voice demo based on the supplied **Receptionist PDF**. Visitors press one button, hear Raqmiva introduce itself in a warm Emirati/Gulf Arabic greeting, and can then speak naturally in Arabic or English. The agent follows mid-conversation language switches without showing a language picker.

## What is implemented

- **Low-latency voice:** the browser streams 16 kHz microphone audio directly to Gemini Live over a secure WebSocket and plays streamed 24 kHz speech. Render issues a short-lived, single-use token; the permanent Google API key stays server-side.
- **Automatic Arabic/English switching:** no language selector or menu prompt. The first greeting is in Emirati Arabic, then Raqmiva follows the caller's language.
- **PDF-grounded RAG:** approved excerpts are indexed in memory and searched locally with a small BM25-style retriever. Core facts are preloaded into the session; only narrow source-specific questions call the retriever, so greetings and common language/demo questions don't wait for lookup and no separate embedding API or vector database is in the response path.
- **Minimal UI:** the landing screen shows the Raqmiva logo/name, a large DEMO title, and a Start button. No transcript, key field, settings panel, or language picker is shown.
- **Silence handling:** after five seconds of caller silence, Raqmiva asks if they need anything else and says it will end the demo call in five seconds. If the caller remains silent for those five seconds, the browser closes the voice session; detected caller speech cancels the countdown.
- **Demo guardrails:** the sample Al Noor Clinic times in the PDF are treated as role-play only. The running demo does not have a live calendar, phone transfer, CRM, or SMS/WhatsApp integration, so Raqmiva must not claim it booked a real appointment, transferred a caller, or sent a message.
- **HTTPS microphone testing:** Next.js is bound to `0.0.0.0`, and dev origins include ngrok and the Arena preview host.

> **Latency note:** retrieval improves grounding; RAG itself does not make model generation faster. This demo avoids an extra embedding/vector-service round trip and only retrieves for factual questions. Voice/audio remains on the direct browser-to-Gemini path.

## Credential safety — do this before publishing

The supplied `key.png` is a screenshot containing a Google AI Studio API credential and is tracked in the repository. Treat that credential as exposed: **revoke it in Google AI Studio and create a fresh key before deployment.** Do not reuse the screenshot key. The app does not serve `key.png` as a web asset and does not include a Google API key in browser code.

Set the replacement key only as the server environment variable `GEMINI_API_KEY`. Never use a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable, commit the key, put it in the page, or ask demo visitors to enter it. The browser receives only a one-use, short-lived Live API token constrained to the configured model and session settings.

## Run locally

Requirements: Node.js 20.9 or newer and npm.

1. In Google AI Studio, revoke the exposed screenshot key and create a fresh Gemini API key with Live API access.
2. Copy `.example.env` to `.env.local` (`Copy-Item .example.env .env.local` in PowerShell) and place the new key in `GEMINI_API_KEY` there. `.example.env` is a template only and is not auto-loaded.
3. Install and start the app:

   ```bash
   npm ci
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` and press **Start conversation**. Browsers permit microphone access on localhost; otherwise use the HTTPS tunnel below.

### Test through ngrok

In one terminal, start the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

In a second terminal, start an HTTPS tunnel:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Open the **HTTPS** forwarding URL ngrok prints (not the local HTTP URL), allow microphone access, and press **Start conversation**. The allowed dev origins include common ngrok domains. Keep the terminal running while testing.

The first visit pre-warms a short-lived session token and the audio worklet. The browser still waits for the visitor's click before asking for microphone permission or opening a Live API session, as required by browser privacy/autoplay policies.

## Deploy to Render

Deploy as a **Node Web Service**, not a static site: the app needs server-side routes to mint constrained tokens and run local RAG.

1. **Rotate the exposed key first.** In Google AI Studio, revoke the credential shown in `key.png` and create a replacement key. Do not paste the replacement into source files or commit it.
2. Push your clean, locally authored feature branch to **your own repository**. In Render, choose **New → Web Service** and connect that repository and branch. The selected branch must contain `@google/genai` in `package.json`; if Render logs show an older `main` commit, change the service's deploy branch before retrying.
3. Set the service options:
   - **Runtime:** Node
   - **Build command:** `npm ci && npm run build`
   - **Start command:** `npm start`
   - **Health check path:** `/api/health`
   - **Region:** choose one close to your audience. Browser audio connects directly to Google; Render only serves the UI, issues the session token, and answers local knowledge lookups.
4. In the Render service's **Environment** tab, add:
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` — the newly created key, entered as a secret value.
   - `GEMINI_LIVE_MODEL` — optional; defaults to `gemini-3.8-live`.
5. Create the Web Service and wait for the build and deploy to finish. Open the generated `https://…onrender.com` URL, allow microphone access, and test both Arabic and English, including a mid-call switch.
6. Share only the demo URL with clients. No API-key field is shown to visitors.

**Render plan and first-click speed:** Free web services spin down after 15 minutes without traffic and can take about a minute to wake. Use an always-on paid instance for a client-facing demo that should respond consistently on the first visit. See [Render's free-service limits](https://render.com/docs/free) and [Next.js deployment guide](https://render.com/docs/deploy-nextjs-app).

## Deployment configuration

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Render service type | Web Service |
| Runtime | Node |
| Build | `npm ci && npm run build` |
| Start | `npm start` |
| Health check | `/api/health` |
| Required secret | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| Optional model | `GEMINI_LIVE_MODEL` (defaults to `gemini-3.8-live`) |

## Useful commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Development server, reachable through ngrok
npm run lint       # ESLint
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript validation
npm run build      # Production build
npm start          # Production server (uses Render's PORT)
```

## Notes for a public demo

- The token endpoint and local knowledge route have lightweight in-process rate limits. They are suitable for a small single-instance demo, not a substitute for distributed abuse controls. Add a shared rate limiter/CAPTCHA before scaling a high-traffic public launch.
- Audio is sent from the visitor's browser directly to Gemini Live; this app does not proxy, persist, or log microphone audio or transcripts.
- The supplied PDF is a demonstration specification, not a real business knowledge base. Add approved business-specific hours, location, prices, and policies before presenting a client-specific receptionist.
